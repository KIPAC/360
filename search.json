    "section": "2.1 Newtonian Gravity 3 Ways",
    "text": "2.1 Newtonian Gravity 3 Ways\n\n Newtonian gravity can be understood from three complementary perspectives, each providing unique insights into the nature of gravitational interactions. In the following sections, we will explore these perspectives: Forces, where we consider how gravitational acceleration arises directly from pairwise interactions or a continuous mass distribution; Potentials, where we describe the gravitational field as a scalar potential that satisfies Poisson’s equation and links mass to field strength; and Action, where the motion of self-gravitating systems is derived from a variational principle. Together, these approaches offer a comprehensive view of the dynamics governed by Newtonian gravity. If it has been a while you may appreciate (re-)watch Feynman’s Messenger lectures on these topics. At the very least they may help to motivate further study.\n\n\n2.1.1 Forces\nIn Newton’s theory the acceleration of a particle is the sum over all other particles of \\(G\\) times the mass times the inverse square of the distance.\n\\[\n\\ddot{\\mathbf{x}}_j=\\sum_{i \\neq j} \\frac{G m_i\\left(\\mathbf{x}_i-\\mathbf{x}_j\\right)}{\\left|\\mathbf{x}_i-\\mathbf{x}_j\\right|^3}\n\\]\nwhere\n\\[\nG \\simeq 6.67 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{~cm}^3 \\mathrm{~g}^{-1} \\mathrm{~s}^{-2}\n\\]\nFor a continuous density distribution this is\n\\[\n\\ddot{\\mathbf{x}}=\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{x})=G \\int d^3 x^{\\prime} \\rho\\left(\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}\\right) \\frac{\\left(\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}-\\mathbf{x}\\right)}{\\left|\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}-\\mathbf{x}\\right|^3}\n\\]\n\n\n2.1.2 Potentials\nThe gravitational acceleration \\(\\mathbf{g}\\) can be written as the negative of the gradient of the gravitational potential \\(\\mathbf{g}=-\\nabla \\Phi\\) where\n\\[\n\\Phi(\\mathbf{x})=-G \\int d^3 x^{\\prime} \\frac{\\rho\\left(\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}\\right)}{\\left|\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}-\\mathbf{x}\\right|}\n\\]\nTaking the gradient of \\(\\Phi(\\mathbf{x})\\) one recovers In addition to the explicit formula for the potential as an spatial integral (25.4) there is also an equivalent local relationship between the Laplacian of the potential \\(\\nabla^2 \\Phi\\) and the density \\(\\rho\\)\n\\[\n\\nabla^2 \\Phi=4 \\pi G \\rho\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhich is Poisson’s equation.\nIf we divide by \\(4 \\pi G\\) and integrate both sides of equation (Equation 1) over an arbitrary volume \\(V\\), and then apply the divergence theorem, we obtain\n\\[\nM = \\int_{V} \\mathrm{~d}^3 \\mathbf{x} \\rho= \\frac{1}{4 \\pi G} \\int_{V} \\mathrm{d}^3 \\mathbf{x} \\nabla^2 \\Phi =\n\\frac{1}{4 \\pi G} \\oint_{\\partial V} \\mathrm{d}^2 \\mathbf{S} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\nabla} \\Phi\n\\]\nThis is Gauss’s theorem and says that the integral of the normal component of \\(\\nabla \\Phi\\) over any closed surface, \\(\\partial V\\), divided by \\(4 \\pi G\\) equals the mass contained within that surface. This says potentials\n\n\n2.1.3 Action for N Self-Gravitating Bodies\nThe action for \\(N\\) self-gravitating bodies is the starting point for deriving their equations of motion using the variational principle. In classical mechanics, the action is expressed as the time integral of the Lagrangian. For self-gravitating bodies, the Lagrangian has two components: the kinetic energy of the particles and the gravitational potential energy between them.\n\n2.1.3.1 General Form of the Action\nThe action \\(S\\) for \\(N\\) self-gravitating bodies is:\n\\[\nS = \\int \\mathcal{L} \\, \\mathrm{d}t,\n\\]\nwhere the Lagrangian \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L} = T - U.\n\\]\nHere:\n\n\\(T\\) is the total kinetic energy of the system.\n\\(U\\) is the total gravitational potential energy of the system.\n\n\n2.1.3.1.1 Kinetic Energy\nThe kinetic energy is:\n\\[\nT = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \\|\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}_i\\|^2,\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(m_i\\) is the mass of the \\(i\\)-th particle.\n\\(\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}_i = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}_i}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\) is the velocity of the \\(i\\)-th particle.\n\n\n\n2.1.3.1.2 Gravitational Potential Energy\nThe gravitational potential energy is:\n\\[\nU = - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{j \\neq i}^N \\frac{G m_i m_j}{\\|\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j\\|},\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(G\\) is the gravitational constant.\n\n\\(\\|\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j\\|\\) is the Euclidean distance between the \\(i\\)-th and \\(j\\)-th particles.\n\nThe factor \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) accounts for double-counting each pair of interactions.\n\n\n\n2.1.3.2 Full Expression for the Action\nSubstituting the kinetic and potential energy terms, the action becomes:\n\\[\nS = \\int \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \\|\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}_i\\|^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{j \\neq i}^N \\frac{G m_i m_j}{\\|\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j\\|} \\right) \\mathrm{d}t.\n\\]\nThis action governs the dynamics of $ N $ self-gravitating bodies under Newtonian gravity.\n\n\n2.1.3.3 Deriving Equations of Motion\nTo find the equations of motion, apply the principle of stationary action:\n\\[\n\\delta S = 0.\n\\]\nVarying \\(S\\) with respect to \\(\\mathbf{r}_i\\) leads to the Euler-Lagrange equations:\n\\[\nm_i \\ddot{\\mathbf{r}}_i = -\\sum_{j \\neq i}^N \\frac{G m_i m_j}{\\|\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j\\|^3} (\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j).\n\\]\nThis is Newton’s second law for the \\(i\\)-th particle in the gravitational field created by the other particles."

We want to build a forward model which uses a library of stellar spectra which we convolve with the correct broad band filters of the specific observations we want to match. We then want to build a forward model which aims to combine our theoretical stars into an image which once the point spread function of HST is applied matches our input data."

There is now a beautifully implemented python version of cosmological PM by Breton (2024), called pysco, which also includes well developed initial conditions generation. I have many example Jupyter notebooks I can share with you also ones related to the Simplex in Cell technique Hahn and Angulo (2016). There are multiple possible projects building on this work.\n\nMake pysco use the phase-space sheet\nE.g. you might incorporate the ideas from Abel, Hahn, and Kaehler (2012), Sousbie and Colombi (2016), and Hahn and Angulo (2016) into pysco.\n\n\nExplore the statistics of 3D cosmological density\nYou might first just use fields as computed through the Lagrangian Perturbation theory implemented in pysco, i.e. the initial conditions. Once you have a pipeline to measure the spatial statistics you are interested in - Kymatio implements 1, 2 and 3D wavelet scattering transforms. Follow Cheng et al. (2023) and characterize the scattering coefficients for evolved cosmological density fields. - Measure the PDFs for the density fields for many different smoothing lengths and compare to the predictions given by pyLDT from Cataneo et al. (2021). - Explore kNN-CDFs from Banerjee and Abel (2021)."

We will start with a 1D model which will help us practice everything we need. If we manage that we can extend it to 2 and 3D. Beattie et al. (2022) study the density PDF in supersonic MHD turbulence. We start by reading this paper to get a sense of the current questions in the field. We will assume as hypothesis that energy cascades only from large scales to samll scales. Hence when we simulate First step then is to use 1D hydro and look at decaying supersonic turbulence."
