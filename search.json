The instability relates to having heavy stars mass segregate towards the center of a star cluster. Once they are more common they tend to dissipate energy to the lowe mass stars in the out parts via two body scattering. This leads the heavy masses to move to smaller radii moving away from equi-partition rather than towards equilibrium. See chapter 7.5.5 of Binney and Tremaine (2008)."

    "section": "Newtonian Gravity 3 Ways",
    "text": "Newtonian Gravity 3 Ways\n\n Newtonian gravity can be understood from three complementary perspectives, each providing unique insights into the nature of gravitational interactions. In the following sections, we will explore these perspectives: Forces, where we consider how gravitational acceleration arises directly from pairwise interactions or a continuous mass distribution; Potentials, where we describe the gravitational field as a scalar potential that satisfies Poisson’s equation and links mass to field strength; and Action, where the motion of self-gravitating systems is derived from a variational principle. Together, these approaches offer a comprehensive view of the dynamics governed by Newtonian gravity. If it has been a while you may appreciate (re-)watch Feynman’s Messenger lectures on these topics. At the very least they may help to motivate further study.\n\nFor gravity the 4th way please sign up for the General Relativity course physics PHYSICS 262: General Relativity\n\nForces\nIn Newton’s theory the acceleration of a particle is the sum over all other particles of \\(G\\) times the mass times the inverse square of the distance.\n\\[\n\\ddot{\\mathbf{x}}_j=\\sum_{i \\neq j} \\frac{G m_i\\left(\\mathbf{x}_i-\\mathbf{x}_j\\right)}{\\left|\\mathbf{x}_i-\\mathbf{x}_j\\right|^3}\n\\]\nwhere\n\\[\nG \\simeq 6.67 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{~cm}^3 \\mathrm{~g}^{-1} \\mathrm{~s}^{-2}\n\\]\nFor a continuous density distribution this is\n\\[\n\\ddot{\\mathbf{x}}=\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{x})=G \\int d^3 x^{\\prime} \\rho\\left(\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}\\right) \\frac{\\left(\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}-\\mathbf{x}\\right)}{\\left|\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}-\\mathbf{x}\\right|^3}\n\\]\n\n\nPotentials\nThe gravitational acceleration \\(\\mathbf{g}\\) can be written as the negative of the gradient of the gravitational potential \\(\\mathbf{g}=-\\nabla \\Phi\\) where\n\\[\n\\Phi(\\mathbf{x})=-G \\int d^3 x^{\\prime} \\frac{\\rho\\left(\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}\\right)}{\\left|\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}-\\mathbf{x}\\right|}\n\\]\nTaking the gradient of \\(\\Phi(\\mathbf{x})\\) one recovers In addition to the explicit formula for the potential as an spatial integral (25.4) there is also an equivalent local relationship between the Laplacian of the potential \\(\\nabla^2 \\Phi\\) and the density \\(\\rho\\)\n\\[\n\\nabla^2 \\Phi=4 \\pi G \\rho\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhich is Poisson’s equation.\nIf we divide by \\(4 \\pi G\\) and integrate both sides of equation (Equation 1) over an arbitrary volume \\(V\\), and then apply the divergence theorem, we obtain\n\\[\nM = \\int_{V} \\mathrm{~d}^3 \\mathbf{x} \\rho= \\frac{1}{4 \\pi G} \\int_{V} \\mathrm{d}^3 \\mathbf{x} \\nabla^2 \\Phi =\n\\frac{1}{4 \\pi G} \\oint_{\\partial V} \\mathrm{d}^2 \\mathbf{S} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\nabla} \\Phi\n\\]\nThis is Gauss’s theorem and says that the integral of the normal component of \\(\\nabla \\Phi\\) over any closed surface, \\(\\partial V\\), divided by \\(4 \\pi G\\) equals the mass contained within that surface. This says average accelerations on the surface are only directly related to the mass contained inside it.\n\n\nAction for N Self-Gravitating Bodies\nThe action for \\(N\\) self-gravitating bodies is the starting point for deriving their equations of motion using the variational principle. In classical mechanics, the action is expressed as the time integral of the Lagrangian. For self-gravitating bodies, the Lagrangian has two components: the kinetic energy of the particles and the gravitational potential energy between them.\n\nGeneral Form of the Action\nThe action \\(S\\) for \\(N\\) self-gravitating bodies is:\n\\[\nS = \\int \\mathcal{L} \\, \\mathrm{d}t,\n\\]\nwhere the Lagrangian \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L} = T - U.\n\\]\nHere:\n\n\\(T\\) is the total kinetic energy of the system.\n\\(U\\) is the total gravitational potential energy of the system.\n\n\nKinetic Energy\nThe kinetic energy is:\n\\[\nT = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \\|\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}_i\\|^2,\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(m_i\\) is the mass of the \\(i\\)-th particle.\n\\(\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}_i = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}_i}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\) is the velocity of the \\(i\\)-th particle.\n\n\n\nGravitational Potential Energy\nThe gravitational potential energy is:\n\\[\nU = - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{j \\neq i}^N \\frac{G m_i m_j}{\\|\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j\\|},\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(G\\) is the gravitational constant.\n\n\\(\\|\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j\\|\\) is the Euclidean distance between the \\(i\\)-th and \\(j\\)-th particles.\n\nThe factor \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) accounts for double-counting each pair of interactions.\n\n\n\nFull Expression for the Action\nSubstituting the kinetic and potential energy terms, the action becomes:\n\\[\nS = \\int \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \\|\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}_i\\|^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{j \\neq i}^N \\frac{G m_i m_j}{\\|\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j\\|} \\right) \\mathrm{d}t.\n\\]\nThis action governs the dynamics of \\(N\\) self-gravitating bodies under Newtonian gravity.\n\n\nDeriving Equations of Motion\nTo find the equations of motion, apply the principle of stationary action:\n\\[\n\\delta S = 0.\n\\]\nVarying \\(S\\) with respect to \\(\\mathbf{r}_i\\) leads to the Euler-Lagrange equations:\n\\[\nm_i \\ddot{\\mathbf{r}}_i = -\\sum_{j \\neq i}^N \\frac{G m_i m_j}{\\|\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j\\|^3} (\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j).\n\\]\nThis is Newton’s second law for the \\(i\\)-th particle in the gravitational field created by the other particles."

The time derivative is \\(\\dot{I}=2 \\sum m \\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\dot{\\mathbf{r}}\\) and taking a further time derivative gives\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\ddot{I}=\\sum m \\dot{r}^2+\\sum m \\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\ddot{\\mathbf{r}}\n\\]\nRequiring that \\(\\ddot{I}\\) vanish for a stable system and expressing the acceleration \\(\\ddot{\\mathbf{r}}\\) as a sum of the gravity from all the other particles gives\n\\[\n2 T+\\sum_{\\mathbf{r}} m \\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\sum_{\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime} \\neq \\mathbf{r}} G m^{\\prime} \\frac{\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}-\\mathbf{r}}{\\left|\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}-\\mathbf{r}\\right|^3}=0\n\\]\nwith \\(T\\) the kinetic energy of the particles. Now switching \\(\\mathbf{r} \\leftrightarrow \\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}\\) in the last term simply changes the sign, so we can write this as\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\sum_{\\mathbf{r}} \\sum_{\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime} \\neq \\mathbf{r}} G m m^{\\prime} \\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\frac{\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}-\\mathbf{r}}{\\left|\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}-\\mathbf{r}\\right|^3} \\\\\n=\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\sum_{\\mathbf{r}} \\sum_{\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime} \\neq \\mathbf{r}} G m m^{\\prime} \\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\frac{\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}-\\mathbf{r}}{\\left|\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}-\\mathbf{r}\\right|^3}-\\sum_{\\mathbf{r}} \\sum_{\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime} \\neq \\mathbf{r}} G m m^{\\prime} \\mathbf{r}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\frac{\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}-\\mathbf{r}}{\\left|\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}-\\mathbf{r}\\right|^3}\\right] \\\\\n=-\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\mathbf{r}} \\sum_{\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime} \\neq \\mathbf{r}} \\frac{G m m^{\\prime}}{\\left|\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}-\\mathbf{r}\\right|}=W\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nand we therefore have the virial theorem\n\\[\n2 T+W=0\n\\]\nThe virial theorem provides a useful way to estimate the mass of bound systems. For example, if we assume equal mass particles, then the particle mass \\(m\\) is given by\n\\[\nm=\\frac{2}{G} \\frac{\\sum \\dot{r}^2}{\\sum_{\\text {pairs }} 1 / r_{12}}\n\\]\nFor a roughly spherical system it is reasonable to assume that the 3-dimensional velocity dispersion in the numerator is 3 times the observed line of sight velocity dispersion. Similarly, the mean harmonic radius which appears in the denominator can be estimated from the observed distribution of projected separations, and this provides a useful way to determine the mass of a gravitating system.\nThe virial theorem gives the correct answer if the luminous particles trace the mass, but will fail if, for example, the dark matter has a different profile from the luminous particles."

A virtual environment is an isolated space where you can manage dependencies specific to a project, without interfering with other Python installations on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:\n\n\nFirst, check if Python 3.10 is installed on your system. Open a terminal or command prompt and run:\npython3.10 --version\nIf this returns something like Python 3.10.x, you’re good to go. If Python 3.10 is not installed, you can download it from the official Python website or use your system’s package manager to install it.\n\n\n\nNavigate to a directory where you’d like to store your virtual environment. If you already have a class folder called 360 you may change into it and execute the commands below:\nThen run:\npython3.10 -m venv myenv\nThis command creates a new virtual environment named myenv in the current directory. Replace myenv with a name of your choice if desired.\n\n\n\nTo activate the virtual environment: - On Linux/macOS:\nsource myenv/bin/activate\n\nOn Windows:\n\nmyenv\\Scripts\\activate\nAfter activation, your terminal prompt will change to indicate that the virtual environment is active.

Use pip to install packages:\npip install numpy matplotlib scipy gala jax taichi plotly\n\n\n\nWhen you’re done working in the virtual environment, deactivate it by running:\ndeactivate\nThis will return your terminal to its normal state.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways activate the virtual environment before running scripts for this class to ensure the correct Python version and dependencies are used.\nIf you ever need to delete the virtual environment, simply remove the myenv directory.\n\nThis process ensures an organized and isolated Python development environment, making it easier to manage dependencies for your coursework."
