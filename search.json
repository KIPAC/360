    "text": "Particle-Mesh Codes in Cosmology\nAndrey Kravtsov wrote a wonderful set of instructions on how to approach writing your own particle mesh code specifically for numerical cosmology. There is now a beautifully implemented python version of cosmological PM by Breton (2024), called pysco, which also includes well developed initial conditions generation. I have many example Jupyter notebooks I can share with you also ones related to the Simplex in Cell technique Hahn and Angulo (2016). There are multiple possible projects building on this work.\n\nMake pysco use the phase-space sheet\nE.g. you might incorporate the ideas from Abel, Hahn, and Kaehler (2012), Sousbie and Colombi (2016), and Hahn and Angulo (2016) into pysco.\n\n\nExplore the statistics of 3D cosmological density\nYou might first just use fields as computed through the Lagrangian Perturbation theory implemented in pysco, i.e. the initial conditions. Once you have a pipeline to measure the spatial statistics you are interested in - Kymatio implements 1, 2 and 3D wavelet scattering transforms. Follow Cheng et al. (2023) and characterize the scattering coefficients for evolved cosmological density fields. - Measure the PDFs for the density fields for many different smoothing lengths and compare to the predictions given by pyLDT from Cataneo et al. (2021). - Explore kNN-CDFs from Banerjee and Abel (2021)."

We will start with a 1D model which will help us practice everything we need. If we manage that we can extend it to 2 and 3D. Beattie et al. (2022) study the density PDF in supersonic MHD turbulence. We start by reading this paper to get a sense of the current questions in the field. First step then is to use 1D hydro"

I.e. how to best organize everything needed to write a successful thesis and the many other things related to it. The talk for the thesis defense, the qual exam, the assembly of the thesis. Make the assignment follow more the “do as I say, rather than do what I do” mantra. I.e. talk more about how you think it might best be done and how you might try to change your own workflow rather than describing parts that do not work to well.

However, also already think about organizing yourself so you can turn all this eventually into a large shared document that can be helpful to all of us as a resource. For the larger resource we may tone down our strongest opinions. I would suggest a structure that separates the writing on publishing/authoring from time management, project tracking as well as from data wrangling and coding while at the same explicitly highlights the threads that connect these areas in as much as it makes sense in your approach.\nHand in your write up through Canvas."

    "section": "",
    "text": "For this class, we will use a dedicated Python virtual environment with Python version 3.10. A virtual environment is an isolated space where you can manage dependencies specific to a project, without interfering with other Python installations on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:\n\n\nFirst, check if Python 3.10 is installed on your system. Open a terminal or command prompt and run:\npython3.10 --version\nIf this returns something like Python 3.10.x, you’re good to go. If Python 3.10 is not installed, you can download it from the official Python website or use your system’s package manager to install it.\n\n\n\nNavigate to a directory where you’d like to store your virtual environment. If you already have a class folder called 360 you may change into it and execute the commands below:\nThen run:\npython3.10 -m venv myenv\nThis command creates a new virtual environment named myenv in the current directory. Replace myenv with a name of your choice if desired.\n\n\n\nTo activate the virtual environment: - On Linux/macOS:\nsource myenv/bin/activate\n\nOn Windows:\n\nmyenv\\Scripts\\activate\nAfter activation, your terminal prompt will change to indicate that the virtual environment is active. All Python packages installed while the virtual environment is active will be isolated from your global Python installation.\n\n\n\nWith the virtual environment activated, you can now install the required Python packages for this class. Use pip to install packages:\npip install numpy matplotlib scipy gala taichi plotly\n\n\n\nWhen you’re done working in the virtual environment, deactivate it by running:\ndeactivate\nThis will return your terminal to its normal state.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways activate the virtual environment before running scripts for this class to ensure the correct Python version and dependencies are used.\nIf you ever need to delete the virtual environment, simply remove the myenv directory.\n\nThis process ensures an organized and isolated Python development environment, making it easier to manage dependencies for your coursework."

We recommend to create a class specific virtual environment\n\n\nTexts and resources\nUseful free textbook for a number of theoretical concepts. - Kaiser: Elements of Astrophysics: Link to PDF\n\n\nSyllabus: Calendar, Reading, and Problem Sets\nCalendar                                         Reading                Problem Set              \nTu  1 Jan 7   Intro/Overview/Gravity             K:285-300              K: 26.7.1 p295 + 1-2 page Proposal \nTh  2 Jan 9   Gravity 3 ways | Stellar dynamics\nTu  3 Jan 14  Cosmology + Spherical Collapse     K:303-308,337-340,385-388  Bertschinger Dust Solution      \nTh  4 Jan 16  Hydrodynamics           I)         K:246-247,251-253                                   \nTu  5 Jan 21  Hydrodynamics          II)                                                                     \nTh  6 Jan 23  Sound Waves, Shocks & Sedov Taylor K:258,22.2,23.2         K:20.10.3 + Bertsch. g=5/3  \nTu  7 Jan 28  Radiation                          K:61-69                                             \nTh  8 Jan 30  Radiation Transport                K:81-89                 K:6.12.1-4 +                \nTu  9 Feb  4  Radiative Processes   I)                                                               \nTh 10 Feb  6  Radiative Processes  II)                                                               \nTu 11 Feb 11  Radiative Processes III)                                   K:14.9.2-3 +                \nTh 12 Feb 13  AT   I)  Spectra of Galaxies       Notes\nTu 13 Feb 18  AT  II)  HII regions               Notes                                           \nTh 14 Feb 20  AT III)  Press Schechter theory    Notes                   reproduce Mo & White 98                                            \nTu 15 Feb 25  AT  IV)  Summary Statistics        Notes \nTh 16 Feb 27  AT   V)  Plasmas/Acceleration      Notes                                          \nTu 17 Mar  4  Presentations   I\nTh 18 Mar  6  Presentations  II                                                                       \nTu 19 Mar 11  Presentations III                                                                       \nTh 20 Mar 13  Presentations  IV                                                                       \n\n\nGrading\n\n40% Final project and presentation\n\n60% Problem set (worst dropped)"
