# Collision-less Systems

Gravity, despite being the weakest of the four fundamental forces, plays a pivotal role on astronomical scales, shaping the structures and dynamics of the universe. Unlike the electromagnetic, strong, and weak forces, which dominate at subatomic and terrestrial scales, gravity’s influence becomes profound over vast distances and when acting on large masses. It governs the formation and evolution of globular clusters, galaxies, and planetary systems, orchestrating the cosmic dance of celestial bodies. Through gravitational attraction, stars coalesce into clusters, galaxies bind their billions of stars together, and planets form stable orbits around their host stars.

In this part of the course, we will delve into collective gravitational phenomena that are essential to understanding astrophysical systems. Key topics include dynamical friction, the process by which massive objects lose momentum and energy due to interactions with a background of less massive particles, shaping the motion of stars and satellites in galaxies. We’ll explore two-body relaxation, which describes how random gravitational encounters between stars in a cluster lead to a redistribution of energy and angular momentum, driving systems toward thermal equilibrium. Lastly, we will study virialization, a crucial concept that describes how self-gravitating systems reach a state of balance between kinetic and potential energy. These phenomena not only underpin the stability and dynamics of astrophysical systems but also provide a framework for understanding their formation, evolution, and ultimate fate.

First let's recall some basic facts of Newtonian gravity. This chapter is mostly based on Part V of **Kaiser**: *Elements of Astrophysics*: [pages 285-300](../resources/PDFs/elements.pdf). The other important book on this subject is @Binney:2008aa which we have [online access](https://www-degruyter-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/document/doi/10.1515/9781400828722/html) to through Stanford Libraries. On the Canvas course site you can find a .pdf version in the files directory. 

## Newtonian Gravity 3 Ways

:::{.image-container}
![A Feynman Messenger](../resources/Images/FeynmanMessenger.png){.float-right style="width:30%;"}
Newtonian gravity can be understood from three complementary perspectives, each providing unique insights into the nature of gravitational interactions. In the following sections, we will explore these perspectives: Forces, where we consider how gravitational acceleration arises directly from pairwise interactions or a continuous mass distribution; Potentials, where we describe the gravitational field as a scalar potential that satisfies Poisson’s equation and links mass to field strength; and Action, where the motion of self-gravitating systems is derived from a variational principle. Together, these approaches offer a comprehensive view of the dynamics governed by Newtonian gravity. If it has been a while you may appreciate (re-)watch [Feynman's Messenger lectures](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/messenger.html) on these topics. At the very least they may help to motivate further study.

### Forces
In Newton's theory the acceleration of a particle is the sum over all other particles of $G$ times the mass times the inverse square of the distance.

$$
\ddot{\mathbf{x}}_j=\sum_{i \neq j} \frac{G m_i\left(\mathbf{x}_i-\mathbf{x}_j\right)}{\left|\mathbf{x}_i-\mathbf{x}_j\right|^3}
$$

where

$$
G \simeq 6.67 \times 10^{-8} \mathrm{~cm}^3 \mathrm{~g}^{-1} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}
$$

For a continuous density distribution this is

$$
\ddot{\mathbf{x}}=\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{x})=G \int d^3 x^{\prime} \rho\left(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\right) \frac{\left(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}-\mathbf{x}\right)}{\left|\mathbf{x}^{\prime}-\mathbf{x}\right|^3}
$$


### Potentials
The gravitational acceleration $\mathbf{g}$ can be written as the negative of the gradient of the gravitational potential $\mathbf{g}=-\nabla \Phi$ where

$$
\Phi(\mathbf{x})=-G \int d^3 x^{\prime} \frac{\rho\left(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\right)}{\left|\mathbf{x}^{\prime}-\mathbf{x}\right|}
$$


Taking the gradient of $\Phi(\mathbf{x})$ one recovers 
In addition to the explicit formula for the potential as an spatial integral (25.4) there is also an equivalent local relationship between the Laplacian of the potential $\nabla^2 \Phi$ and the density $\rho$

$$
\nabla^2 \Phi=4 \pi G \rho
$$ {#eq-poisson}

which is Poisson's equation.

If we divide by $4 \pi G$ and integrate both sides of equation (@eq-poisson) over an arbitrary volume $V$, and then apply the divergence theorem, we obtain

$$
M = \int_{V} \mathrm{~d}^3 \mathbf{x} \rho= \frac{1}{4 \pi G} \int_{V} \mathrm{d}^3 \mathbf{x} \nabla^2 \Phi = 
\frac{1}{4 \pi G} \oint_{\partial V} \mathrm{d}^2 \mathbf{S} \cdot \boldsymbol{\nabla} \Phi
$$


This  is Gauss's theorem and says that the integral of the normal component of $\nabla \Phi$ over any closed surface, $\partial V$, divided by $4 \pi G$ equals the mass contained within that surface. This says potentials 


### Action for N Self-Gravitating Bodies

The action for $N$ self-gravitating bodies is the starting point for deriving their equations of motion 
using the variational principle. In classical mechanics, the action is expressed as the time integral of the 
Lagrangian. For self-gravitating bodies, the Lagrangian has two components: 
the kinetic energy of the particles and the gravitational potential energy between them.

#### General Form of the Action

The action $S$ for $N$ self-gravitating bodies is:

$$
S = \int \mathcal{L} \, \mathrm{d}t,
$$

where the Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}$ is given by:

$$
\mathcal{L} = T - U.
$$

Here:

- $T$ is the total kinetic energy of the system.
  
- $U$ is the total gravitational potential energy of the system.

##### Kinetic Energy
The kinetic energy is:

$$
T = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \|\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i\|^2,
$$

where:

- $m_i$ is the mass of the $i$-th particle.
  
- $\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}_i}{\mathrm{d}t}$ is the velocity of the $i$-th particle.

##### Gravitational Potential Energy
The gravitational potential energy is:

$$
U = - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j \neq i}^N \frac{G m_i m_j}{\|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j\|},
$$

where:

- $G$ is the gravitational constant.
- 
- $\|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j\|$ is the Euclidean distance between the $i$-th and $j$-th particles.

The factor $\frac{1}{2}$ accounts for double-counting each pair of interactions.

#### Full Expression for the Action

Substituting the kinetic and potential energy terms, the action becomes:

$$
S = \int \left( \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \|\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i\|^2 + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j \neq i}^N \frac{G m_i m_j}{\|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j\|} \right) \mathrm{d}t.
$$

This action governs the dynamics of $ N $ self-gravitating bodies under Newtonian gravity.

#### Deriving Equations of Motion

To find the equations of motion, apply the principle of stationary action:

$$
\delta S = 0.
$$

Varying $S$ with respect to $\mathbf{r}_i$ leads to the Euler-Lagrange equations:

$$
m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = -\sum_{j \neq i}^N \frac{G m_i m_j}{\|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j\|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j).
$$

This is Newton's second law for the $i$-th particle in the gravitational field created by the other particles.
