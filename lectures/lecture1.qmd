# Modern Astrophysics

This course is directed at first/second year graduate students interested in astrophysics research. We cover a few of the important physical processes necessary to understand astronomical objects and observations. The course will use python notebooks throughout helping with experiential learning and give the student resources to explore the code/formulas and algorithms behind the plots and animations.

# Course Notes and Schedule

### Texts and resources
