# Physics 360: Modern Astrophysics

This repository contains all materials for the Physics 360 course at Stanford. 

This include all the materials that contribute to the [course website](https://kipac.github.io/360/)

All content is managed and published using [quarto](quarto.org). 



We hope the setup of this repository could serve as a template also for some of our students. 
We think it could serve as a fairly general approach to organize ones scientific work mixing research, publishing, coding, version control, automatic backups, etc.  
Consequently we would appreciate any suggestions to improve the repo, its organization and its suggested workflow. 

In vscode or from the terminal we publish the quarto source to github.io pages using. 
```bash
quarto publish gh-pages
```
